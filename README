Core-C
============

The coreC repository is a historical artifact showcasing the initial backbone of
the A.D.A. project. This repository contains code written in C, serving as an
alternative implementation to the Rust-based core repository. While it is no
longer actively maintained, it provides insights into an earlier approach to the
project.
